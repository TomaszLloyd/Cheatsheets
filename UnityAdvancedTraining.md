## Unity Advanced Training Notes

### The Art of Effective Training

Why?

+ Being a great teacher means always being a student.

#### Workflow Vs. Buttonology

Workflow: The teaching of a process which will enable learners to apply knowledge to new situations
Buttonology: The teaching of unique buttons in an interface with no connection to process.

#### Lesson Plan

+ Students hold you under a microscope

Sample lesson plan:

```
Introduction to Physics:

Description: This module will introduce learners to the 3D Physics system in Unity.

Objectives: After this lesson, learners will be able to apply Physics components to GameObjects

Topics: Colliders, Rigidbodies, Physic materials
```

What is a goal?

A goal is general. "Prepare Trainers to teach Unity effectively using bootcamp projects"

Objective:

example: "After this lesson, learners will be able to apply 3D Physics componnets to a character."

Discrete and measurable

Suport objects with Topics:

1. Colliders
2. Physic Materials
3. Rigidbodies

Let's you know what's being covered and what's NOT being covered.

Topics are points or areas to cover while reaching toward an objective.

Bloom's Taxonomy
1956 Dr. Benjamin Bloom, an educational psychologist, created a taxonomy in order to promote higher forms of thinking in education, such as analyzing and evaluating concepts, processes, procedures, and principles, rather than just remembering facts (rote learning).

Top-to-bottom:
```
     / Evaluation \
    /   Synthesis  \
   /    Analysis    \
  /   Application    \
 /   Comprehension    \
/      Knowledge       \
```

Bloom's Taxonomy Verbs: action verbs for each of the levels of the taxonomy. i.e. for Application: "today we will -build- a 2d side scroller"

Action verbs:

Instructors should avoid using verbs such as the following:
+ Learn
+ Understand
+ Ensure
+ Appreciate
+ Know
+ Accept
+ Believe
+ Be aware of...
+ Be familiar with...

Learning cycles consist of:

```
--> Lecture --> Demo --> Activity -
^----------------------------------|
```

Lecture should be smallest, demo is next, then activity should take the most time

Reasonably a human can keep track of 1 or 2 things as a learner whether they're visual, auditory, hand-coordination learners, etc

Activity 01:

Write three objectives about teaching a subject in the Unity Editor. Your objectives must cover low, medium, and high cognitive complexity. Assume all objectives will be prefaced with "After completing this lesson, learners will be able to...". Three levels of objectives (easy, medium, hard)

Example:

1. Identify 3D Physics componnets on a GameObject

1. After completing this lesson, learners will be able to... identify anchors and pivots in UI elements
1. After completing this lesson, learners will be able to... optimize their UI layout using anchors and pivots
2. After completing this lesson, learners will be able to... apply audio reverb zones to improve how their game sounds
3. After completing this lesson, learners will be able to... optimize their in game models for mobile applications

To approach universities:
+ Give examples of current courses offered at other locations
+ Discrete objectives for course
+ Assets off asset store
+ Create whitebox primitives and game mechanics
+ No prior Unity programming knowledge required

Directional phrasing:

| Component | Direcitonal Phrases |
| --- | --- |
| Lecture	| We | Us | Let's All |
| Demonstration |	I | Me | The instructor |
| Activity | You | Everyone else | You are / you all |
